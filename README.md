# UCL Biosciences Computational Research Support
This repository provides information about computational research support activities in UCL's Division of Biosciences. It is intended as a reference point for internal collaborators and external visitors who want to understand our scope, events, and how to engage with us:

## Computational Support
The Data Science team helps researchers across UCL Biosciences to plan, run, and maintain computational analyses. We focus on building sustainable and reproducible workflows, improving data management, and supporting skills development.

We can assist with:
- **Analysis pipelines**: guidance on standardised workflows for proteomics, sequencing, imaging, and other data types.
- **HPC use**: advice on running jobs efficiently, using job arrays, and resource selection.
- **Code and reproducibility**: structuring analysis code, version control, and environment management.
- **Training and mentoring**: workshops and 1:1 sessions on coding, reproducibility and data science best practice.
- **Collaboration setup**: where capacity allows, we can collaborate directly on grant applications, data analysis and writing up results in papers.
- **Networking**: we want to do more to connect people across the Division and across UCL, especially UCL's Centre for Advanced Research Computing. If you would like to meet researchers with similar interests and/or specific computational expertise, please get in touch to see if we can help. 

Contact us early in your project to discuss requirements or explore automation and reproducibility improvements.

## Events

The table below lists upcoming and recent events. It is automatically generated from individual event files in the `events/` folder. To add an event follow the instructions in `events/add-an-event.md`. A GitHub Action will update this table automatically.
